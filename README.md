# Hi, I'm Zoowayss 👋

I'm an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Sydney.  
I use GitHub mainly to keep track of things I try out while learning and experimenting with code.

## About
I mostly write **Java**, and sometimes use **Python** or **JavaScript**, depending on what I’m working on.  
A lot of the code here comes from coursework practice, self-learning, or just testing ideas, so projects can be simple, unfinished, or change over time.

## Stuff I work with
- Java / Python / JavaScript  
- Spring Boot, basic web stuff  
- Git, Linux  
- MySQL, PostgreSQL  

## Repos
Some things you might see here:

- **collaborative-filtering**  
  A small project I made while learning recommendation system ideas.

- **requests-java**  
  A Java HTTP client I wrote while experimenting with networking and APIs.

Most repos here are learning notes in code form 🙂

That’s pretty much it.
